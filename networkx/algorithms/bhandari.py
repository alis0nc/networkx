    Parameters
    ----------

       Starting node for path

    Returns
    -------
    paths: list
       A list of disjoint paths, each represented as a list. If there

    Works for digraphs with negative edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
        Starting node for path.

    target : node, optional
        Ending node for path.
        If not specified, compute shortest paths using all nodes as target nodes.

    weight : None or string, optional (default = 'weight')
        If None, every edge has weight/distance/cost 1.
        If a string, use this edge attribute as the edge weight.
        Any edge attribute not present defaults to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    path: list or dictionary
        All returned paths include both the source and target in the path.

        If the source and target are both specified, return a single list
        of nodes in a shortest path from the source to the target.

        If only the source is specified, return a dictionary keyed by
        targets with a list of nodes in a shortest path from the source
        to one of the targets.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> print(nx.bellman_ford_path(G,source=0,target=4))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    >>> print p
    {0: [0], 1: [0, 1], 2: [0, 1, 2], 3: [0, 1, 2, 3], 4: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]}
    >>> print p[4]
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]


    Notes
    -----
    There may be more than one shortest path between a source and target.
    This returns only one of them.

    For digraphs this returns a shortest directed path. To find paths in the
    reverse direction first use G.reverse(copy=False) to flip the edge
    orientation.
